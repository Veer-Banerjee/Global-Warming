            <h3>WHAT IS GLOBAL WARMING?</h3>
            <p> 
        <div class="intro row flex"> 
               <p> Global warming is a term used for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Scientists are more than 95% certain that nearly all of global warming is caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other human-caused emissions.
                Within the earth's atmosphere, accumulating greenhouse gases like water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the gases within the atmosphere that absorb and emit heat radiation. Increasing or decreasing amounts of greenhouse gases within the atmosphere act to either hold in or release more of the heat from the sun.
                Our atmosphere is getting hotter, more turbulent, and more unpredictable because of the ‚Äúboiling and churning‚Äù effect caused by the heat-trapping greenhouse gases within the upper layers of our atmosphere. With each increase of carbon, methane, or other greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere, our local weather and global climate is further agitated, heated, and ‚Äúboiled.‚Äù
                Global warming is gauged by the increase in the average global temperature of the Earth. Along with our currently increasing average global temperature, some parts of the Earth may actually get colder while other parts get warmer‚Äîhence the idea of average global temperature. Greenhouse gas-caused atmospheric heating and agitation also increase the unpredictability of the weather and climate and dramatically increase the severity, scale, and frequency of storms, droughts, wildfires, and extreme temperatures.
                Global warming can reach levels of irreversibility as it has now, and increasing levels of global warming can eventually reach an extinction level where humanity and all life on earth will end. In this book, irreversible global warming is partially defined as a continuum of increasing temperature that causes the global climate to rapidly change until those higher temperatures become irreversible on practical human time scales. The eventual temperature range associated with triggering and marking the beginning of the irreversible global warming processes is an increase in average global temperature of 2.2¬∞-4¬∞ Celsius (4¬∞-7.2¬∞ Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels

             <h3>CAUSES OF GLOBAL WARMING</h3>
             <div class="causes row-reverse flex">
             <p>
                Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth‚Äôs surface. Normally, this radiation would escape into space‚Äîbut these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.
                In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat-trapping pollution, producing about two billion tons of CO2 every year. Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country‚Äôs second-largest source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector, which generates about 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions a year.                
                Curbing dangerous climate change requires very deep cuts in emissions, as well as the use of alternatives to fossil fuels worldwide. The good news is that we‚Äôve started a turnaround: CO2 emissions in the United States actually decreased from 2005 to 2014, thanks in part to new, energy-efficient technology and the use of cleaner fuels. And scientists continue to develop new ways to modernize power plants, generate cleaner electricity, and burn less gasoline while we drive. The challenge is to be sure these solutions are put to use and widely adopted.
                When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas to create electricity or power our cars, we release CO2 pollution into the atmosphere.
                Australians are big producers of CO2 pollution compared to the rest of the world. Our level of CO2 pollution per person is nearly double the average of other developed nations and more than four times the world average.
                Electricity generation is the main cause of carbon pollution in Australia as 73% of our electricity comes from burning coal and 13% from burning gas. The remaining 14% comes from renewable energy sources such as hydro, solar and wind, which do not emit carbon.                
                Plants and trees play an important role in regulating the climate because they absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen back into it. Forests and bushland act as carbon sinks and are a valuable means of keeping global warming to 1.5¬∞C.
                But humans clear vast areas of vegetation around the world for farming, urban and infrastructure development or to sell tree products such as timber and palm oil. When vegetation is removed or burnt, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, contributing to global warming.
                Animals, particularly livestock like sheep and cattle, produce methane, a greenhouse gas. When livestock are grazed at a large scale, as in Australia, the amount of methane produced is a big contributor to global warming.
                Some fertilisers that farmers use also release nitrous oxide, which is another greenhouse gas.

             <h3>EFFECTS OF GLOBAL WARMING</h3>
             <div class="effects row flex">
             <p>
                Almost 200 countries signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 which included the target of limiting global temperatures to ‚Äòwell below 2¬∞C and pursue efforts to below 1.5¬∞C‚Äô. However the UN‚Äôs Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has published a report warning governments of the stark difference of a 1.5¬∞C warmer world compared with 2¬∞C. How is this different from previous warnings?
                Myles Allen, Coordinating Lead Author, IPCC Report: At the time of the Paris Agreement there wasn‚Äôt a lot of research on what a 1.5¬∞C world meant so governments commissioned the IPCC to write this report. Crucially this report doesn‚Äôt tell governments what to do ‚Äì it‚Äôs not the job of the IPCC to prescribe policy ‚Äì we, as a group of scientists, are just here to inform governments about what the implications of different policies are. Therefore this report was to establish if, and what, the benefits were of limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C as opposed to allowing it to rise to 2¬∞C and what it would take to actually achieve it.
                The key findings of the report are that, on the one hand, there are significant benefits of limiting global warming to 1.5¬∞C. For example, some coral reefs would survive in a 1.5¬∞C world whereas almost none of them would survive in a 2¬∞C world. That‚Äôs a clear difference between these two scenarios. There were also a number of other aspects we focussed on such as the health impacts, economic impacts and so forth.
                On the other hand, we had to look at the prospects of achieving 1.5¬∞C and what we would have to do to our global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We found that it would be necessary to get GHG emissions down to zero by mid-century rather than at the end of the century which presents a substantial challenge for governments.
                Ovais Sarmad, Deputy Executive Secretary, UNFCCC: The IPCC report is also extremely important in the sense that it comes at a crucial time: this year governments need to agree on finalizing the rulebook for the Paris Agreement which will then make the accord operational.
                The report, although not directly linked to this political process, feeds into it through the Talanoa Dialogue too as it helps to build the environment in which those decisions will be taken. It provides the scientific ‚Äì even moral ‚Äì imperative for political leaders to use this in their decision-making at the annual UN Climate Change Conference in Poland in December.
                The difference between global temperatures rising by just half a degree could be the difference between millions of more people and countless species being affected by droughts, sea level rise, heatwaves, water scarcity and food shortages. Do you think it‚Äôs possible to limit global warming by 1.5¬∞C?
